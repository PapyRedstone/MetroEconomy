     This manual documents ffeehh 2.23.2

     Compile-time switches: libcurl support enabled, Xinerama support enabled, builtin EXIF support enabled

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ffeehh is a mode-based image viewer.  It is especially aimed at command line users who need a fast image viewer without huge GUI dependencies, though it can also be started by (graphical) file
     managers to view an image.  By default (unless arguments or a filelist are specified), ffeehh displays all files in the current directory.

     ffeehh supports filelists, various image sorting modes, image captions, HTTP and more.  It can be controlled by configurable keyboard and mouse shortcuts, terminal input and signals.

     In many desktop environments, ffeehh can also be used as wallpaper setter.

     EXIF tags are supported either using exiv2 / exifgrep via ----iinnffoo (see the _U_S_A_G_E _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_S section), or as a builtin feature by compiling ffeehh with exif=1. In this build of ffeehh, builtin EXIF sup‐
     port is enabled.

MMOODDEESS
     ffeehh is based on various modes, which are selected at startup by command line options.

     Slideshow mode is the default.  It opens a window and displays the first image in it; the slideshow position can be advanced (or otherwise changed) using keyboard and mouse shortcuts.  In
     slideshow mode, images can be deleted either from the filelist or from the disk, a changed filelist can also be saved to the disk and reopened at a later time.  An image can also be read from
     stdin via "feh -".

     Montage mode forms a montage from the filelist.  The resulting image can be viewed or saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Index mode forms an index print from the filelist.  Image thumbnails are shown along with the filename, filesize and pixel size, printed using a truetype font of your choice.  The resulting
     image can be viewed or saved, and its size can be limited by height, width or both.

     Thumbnail mode is like index mode, but the mini-images are clickable and open the selected image in a new window.

     Multiwindow mode shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a slideshow in one window.  Don't use with a large filelist ;)

     List mode doesn't display images.  Instead, it outputs an llss-style listing of the files in the filelist, including image info such as size, number of pixels, type, etc.  There is also a Custom‐
     list mode which prints image info in a custom format specified by a printf-like format string.

     ffeehh can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the unloadable files.  This is useful for preening a directory.

SSUUPPPPOORRTTEEDD FFOORRMMAATTSS
     ffeehh can open any format supported by Imlib2, most notably jpeg, png, pnm, tiff, and bmp. The gif format is also supported, but only for static images. In case of animations, only the first
     frame will be shown.  If the convert binary (supplied by ImageMagick) is available, it also has limited support for many other filetypes, such as svg, xcf and otf. Use ----mmaaggiicckk--ttiimmeeoouutt _n_u_m with
     a non-negative value to enable it.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     --AA, ----aaccttiioonn [_f_l_a_g][[_t_i_t_l_e]]_a_c_t_i_o_n
             Specify a shell command as an action to perform on the image.  In slideshow or multiwindow mode, the action will be run when the action_0 key is pressed, in list mode, it will be run
             for each file.  In loadable/unloadable mode, it will be run for each loadable/unloadable file, respectively.  In thumbnail mode, clicking on an image will cause the action to run
             instead of opening the image.

             If _f_l_a_g is ";", ffeehh will reload the current image instead of switching to the next one (slideshow mode) or closing the window (multiwindow mode) after executing the action.  If [_t_i_t_l_e]
             is specified (note the literal "[" and "]"), ----ddrraaww--aaccttiioonnss will display _t_i_t_l_e instead of _a_c_t_i_o_n in the action list. Note that _t_i_t_l_e must not start with a space. If it does, the action
             is handled as if it did not have a title. This special case exists for backwards compatibility reasons and makes sure that actions like "[ -L %F ] && foo" still work.

             The action will be executed by /bin/sh.  Use format specifiers to refer to image info, see _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S for details.  Example usage: "feh -A "mv ~/images/%N" *".

             Extra actions which can be set and triggered using the appropriate number key.

     ----aauuttoo--rroottaattee
             (only if compiled with exif=1) Automatically rotate images based on EXIF data. Does not alter the image files.

     --ZZ, ----aauuttoo--zzoooomm
             Zoom pictures to screen size in fullscreen / fixed geometry mode.

     --xx, ----bboorrddeerrlleessss
             Create borderless windows.

     ----ccaacchhee--ssiizzee _s_i_z_e
             Set Imlib2 in-memory cache to _s_i_z_e MiB. A higher cache size can significantly improve performance especially for small slide shows, however at the cost of increased memory consumption.
             _s_i_z_e must be between 0 and 2048 MiB and defaults to 4.

     --PP, ----ccaacchhee--tthhuummbbnnaaiillss
             Enable thumbnail caching in _~_/_._t_h_u_m_b_n_a_i_l_s.  Only works with thumbnails <= 256x256 pixels.

     --KK, ----ccaappttiioonn--ppaatthh _p_a_t_h
             Path to directory containing image captions.  This turns on caption viewing, and if captions are found in _p_a_t_h, which is relative to the directory of each image, they are overlayed on
             the displayed image.  E.g. with caption path "captions/", and viewing image "images/foo.jpg", the caption will be looked for in "images/captions/foo.jpg.txt".

     --LL, ----ccuussttoommlliisstt _f_o_r_m_a_t
             Don't display images, print image info according to _f_o_r_m_a_t instead.  See _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S.

     ----ccyyccllee--oonnccee
             Exit ffeehh after one loop through the slideshow.

     --GG, ----ddrraaww--aaccttiioonnss
             Draw the defined actions and what they do at the top-left of the image.

     ----ddrraaww--eexxiiff
             (only if compiled with exif=1) display some EXIF information in the bottom left corner, similar to using ----iinnffoo with exiv2 / exifgrep .

     --dd, ----ddrraaww--ffiilleennaammee
             Draw the filename at the top-left of the image.

     ----ddrraaww--ttiinntteedd
             Show overlay texts (as created by ----ddrraaww--ffiilleennaammee et al) on a semi-transparent background to improve their readability

     --ff, ----ffiilleelliisstt _f_i_l_e
             This option is similar to the playlists used by music software.  If _f_i_l_e exists, it will be read for a list of files to load, in the order they appear.  The format is a list of image
             filenames, absolute or relative to the current directory, one filename per line.

             If _f_i_l_e doesn't exist, it will be created from the internal filelist at the end of a viewing session.  This is best used to store the results of complex sorts (--SSppiixxeellss for example) for
             later viewing.

             Any changes to the internal filelist (such as deleting a file or it being pruned for being unloadable) will be saved to _f_i_l_e when ffeehh exits.  You can add files to filelists by specify‐
             ing them on the command line when also specifying the list.

             If _f_i_l_e is "-", ffeehh will read the filelist from its standard input.

     --ee, ----ffoonntt _f_o_n_t
             Set global font.  Should be a truetype font, resident in the current directory or the font directory, and should be defined in the form fontname/points, like "myfont/12".

     --CC, ----ffoonnttppaatthh _p_a_t_h
             Specify _p_a_t_h as extra directory in which to search for fonts; can be used multiple times to add multiple paths.

     ----ffoorrccee--aalliiaassiinngg
             Disable antialiasing for zooming, background setting etc.

     --II, ----ffuulllliinnddeexx
             Same as index mode, but with additional information below the thumbnails.  Works just like "feh --index --index-info "%n\n%S\n%wx%h"".  Enables _M_O_N_T_A_G_E _M_O_D_E _O_P_T_I_O_N_S.

             Note: This option needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of the ffeehh window, so when using it with many files it will take a while before a ffeehh window is visible.  Use
             ----pprreellooaadd to get a progress bar.

     --FF, ----ffuullllssccrreeeenn
             Make the window fullscreen.  Note that in this mode, large images will always be scaled down to fit the screen, ----zzoooomm _z_o_o_m only affects smaller images and never scales larger than nec‐
             essary to fit the screen size. The only exception is a _z_o_o_m of 100, in which case images will always be shown at 100% zoom, no matter their dimensions.

             When combined with ----tthhuummbbnnaaiillss, this option only affects images opened from the thumbnail overview. The thumbnail list itself will still be windowed.

     --gg, ----ggeeoommeettrryy [_w_i_d_t_h x _h_e_i_g_h_t] [+ _x + _y]
             Limit (and don't change) the window size.  Takes an X-style geometry _s_t_r_i_n_g like 640x480 with optional +x+y window offset.  Note that larger images will be zoomed out to fit, but you
             can see them at 1:1 by clicking the zoom button.  Also note that this option does not enforce the geometry, changing it by a tiling WM or manually is still possible. After each resize,
             the resulting window size is used as the new size limit.

     --YY, ----hhiiddee--ppooiinntteerr
             Hide the pointer (useful for slideshows).

     --BB, ----iimmaaggee--bbgg _s_t_y_l_e
             Use style as background for transparent image parts and the like.  Accepted values: checks, white, black.  The default for windowed mode is checks, while fullscreen defaults to black.

     --ii, ----iinnddeexx
             Enable Index mode.  Index mode is similar to montage mode, and accepts the same options.  It creates an index print of thumbnails, printing the image name beneath each thumbnail.  Index
             mode enables certain other options, see _I_N_D_E_X _A_N_D _T_H_U_M_B_N_A_I_L _M_O_D_E _O_P_T_I_O_N_S and _M_O_N_T_A_G_E _M_O_D_E _O_P_T_I_O_N_S.

     ----iinnffoo [_f_l_a_g]_c_o_m_m_a_n_d_l_i_n_e
             Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_l_i_n_e and display its output in the bottom left corner of the image.  Can be used to display e.g. image dimensions or EXIF information.  Supports _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S.  If
             _f_l_a_g is set to ";", the output will not be displayed by default, but has to be enabled by the toggle_info key.

     --kk, ----kkeeeepp--hhttttpp
             When viewing files using HTTP, ffeehh normally deletes the local copies after viewing, or, if caching, on exit.  This option permanently stores them on disk, either in the directory speci‐
             fied by ----oouuttppuutt--ddiirr, or in the current working directory.

     ----iinnsseeccuurree
             When viewing files with HTTPS, this option disables strict hostname and peer checking. This allows images on sites with self-signed certificates to be opened, but is no more secure than
             plain HTTP.

     ----kkeeeepp--zzoooomm--vvpp
             When switching images, keep zoom and viewport settings (zoom level and X, Y offsets)

     --ll, ----lliisstt
             Don't display images.  Analyze them and display an ls(1) - style listing.  Useful in scripts to hunt out images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.

     --UU, ----llooaaddaabbllee
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image failed to load.

     ----mmaaggiicckk--ttiimmeeoouutt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
             Stop trying to convert unloadable files after _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds. A negative value disables covert / magick support altogether, a value of zero causes ffeehh to try indefinitely. By default,
             magick support is disabled.  Note that feh may clutter _/_t_m_p with temporary files created by ImageMagick for each failed conversion attempt.  This is a known bug.

     ----mmaaxx--ddiimmeennssiioonn _w_i_d_t_h x _h_e_i_g_h_t
             Only show images with width <= _w_i_d_t_h and height <= _h_e_i_g_h_t.  If you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0 (or a negative value).

     --MM, ----mmeennuu--ffoonntt _f_o_n_t
             Use _f_o_n_t (truetype, with size, like "yudit/12") as menu font.

     ----mmiinn--ddiimmeennssiioonn _w_i_d_t_h x _h_e_i_g_h_t
             Only show images with width >= _w_i_d_t_h and height >= _h_e_i_g_h_t.  If you only care about one parameter, set the other to 0.

     --mm, ----mmoonnttaaggee
             Enable montage mode.  Montage mode creates a new image consisting of a grid of thumbnails of the images in the filelist.  When montage mode is selected, certain other options become
             available.  See _M_O_N_T_A_G_E _M_O_D_E _O_P_T_I_O_N_S.

     --ww, ----mmuullttiiwwiinnddooww
             Disable slideshow mode.  With this setting, instead of opening multiple files in slideshow mode, multiple windows will be opened; one per file.

     ----nnoo--jjuummpp--oonn--rreessoorrtt
             Don't jump to the first image after resorting the filelist.

     --NN, ----nnoo--mmeennuuss
             Don't load or show any menus.

     ----nnoo--ssccrreeeenn--cclliipp
             By default, window sizes are limited to the screen size.  With this option, windows will have the size of the image inside them.  Note that they may become very large this way, making
             them unmanageable in certain window managers.

     ----nnoo--xxiinneerraammaa
             Disable Xinerama support.  Only makes sense when you have Xinerama support compiled in.

     --jj, ----oouuttppuutt--ddiirr _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
             Save files to _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y (only useful with -k).  By default, files are saved in the current working directory.

     --pp, ----pprreellooaadd
             Preload images.  This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run through them and eliminate unloadable images first.  Otherwise they will be removed as you flick through.  This also
             analyses the images to get data for use in sorting, such as pixel size, type etc.  A preload run will be automatically performed if you specify one of these sort modes.

     --qq, ----qquuiieett
             Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads.  Verbose and quiet modes are not mutually exclusive, the first controls informational messages, the second only errors.

     --zz, ----rraannddoommiizzee
             When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomize the file list before displaying. The list is re-randomized whenever the slideshow cycles (that is, transitions from last to first
             image).

     --rr, ----rreeccuurrssiivvee
             Recursively expand any directories in the commandline arguments to the content of those directories, all the way down to the bottom level.

     ----nnoo--rreeccuurrssiivvee
             Don't recursively expand any directories (enabled by default).  Useful to override theme options.

     --RR, ----rreellooaadd _i_n_t
             Reload filelist and current image after _i_n_t seconds.  Useful for viewing HTTP webcams or frequently changing directories.  (Note that the filelist reloading is still experimental.)

             If an image is removed, ffeehh will either show the next one or quit.  However, if an image still exists, but can no longer be loaded, ffeehh will continue to try loading it.

     --nn, ----rreevveerrssee
             Reverse the sort order.  Use this to invert the order of the filelist.  E.g. to sort in reverse width order, use --nnSSwwiiddtthh.

     --.., ----ssccaallee--ddoowwnn
             Scale images to fit window geometry (defaults to screen size when no geometry was specified). Note that the window geometry is not updated when changing images at the moment. This
             option is recommended for tiling window managers.  This option is ignored when in fullscreen and thumbnail list mode.

             In tiling environments, this also causes the image to be centered in the window.

     ----ssccrroollll--sstteepp _c_o_u_n_t
             Scroll _c_o_u_n_t pixels whenever scroll_up, scroll_down, scroll_left or scroll_right is pressed.  Note that this option accepts negative numbers in case you need to inverse the scroll
             direction; see _K_E_Y_S _C_O_N_F_I_G _S_Y_N_T_A_X to change it permanently.  Default: 20

             For slideshow mode, wait _f_l_o_a_t seconds between automatically changing slides.  Useful for presentations.  Specify a negative number to set the delay (which will then be _f_l_o_a_t * (-1)),
             but start ffeehh in paused mode.

     --SS, ----ssoorrtt _s_o_r_t___t_y_p_e
             The file list may be sorted according to image parameters.  Allowed sort types are: name, filename, dirname, mtime, width, height, pixels, size, format.  For sort modes other than name,
             filename, dirname, or mtime, a preload run will be necessary, causing a delay proportional to the number of images in the list.

             The mtime sort mode sorts images by most recently modified. To sort by oldest first, reverse the filelist with --reverse.

     --||, ----ssttaarrtt--aatt _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
             Start the filelist at _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Note that at the moment, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must match an (expanded) path in the filelist. So, if the file to be matched is passed via an absolute path in the
             filelist, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must be an absolute path. If the file is passed via a relative path, _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e must be an identical relative path. This is a known issue.  See also _U_S_A_G_E _E_X_A_M_P_L_E_S.

     --TT, ----tthheemmee _t_h_e_m_e
             Load options from config file with name _t_h_e_m_e - see _T_H_E_M_E_S _C_O_N_F_I_G _S_Y_N_T_A_X for more info.  Note that commandline options always override theme options.  The theme can also be set via the
             program name (e.g. with symlinks), so by default ffeehh will look for a "ffeehh" theme.

     --tt, ----tthhuummbbnnaaiillss
             Same as Index mode, but the thumbnails are clickable image launchers.  Note that ----ffuullllssccrreeeenn and ----ssccaallee--ddoowwnn do not affect the thumbnail window. They do, however, work for image win‐

     --~~, ----tthhuummbb--ttiittllee _s_t_r_i_n_g
             Set _t_i_t_l_e for windows opened from thumbnail mode.  See also _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S.

     --^^, ----ttiittllee _t_i_t_l_e
             Set window title.  Applies to all windows except those opened from thumbnail mode.  See _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S.

     --uu, ----uunnllooaaddaabbllee
             Don't display images.  Just print out their names if imlib2 can NOT successfully load them.  Returns false if at least one image was loadable.

     --VV, ----vveerrbboossee
             output useful information, progress bars, etc.

     --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
             output version information and exit.

     ----xxiinneerraammaa--iinnddeexx _s_c_r_e_e_n
             Override ffeehh's idea of the active Xinerama screen. May be useful in certain circumstances where the window manager places the feh window on Xinerama screen A while ffeehh assumes that it
             will be placed on screen B.

             In background setting mode: When used with any option other than ----bbgg--ttiillee: Only set wallpaper on _s_c_r_e_e_n.  All other screens will be filled black/white.  This is most useful in a Xin‐
             erama configuration with overlapping screens.  For instance, assume you have two overlapping displays (index 0 and 1), where index 0 is smaller. To center a background on the display
             with index 0 and fill the extra space on index 1 black/white, use "--xinerama-index 0" when setting the wallpaper.

     ----zzoooomm _p_e_r_c_e_n_t | mmaaxx | ffiillll
             Zoom images by _p_e_r_c_e_n_t when in full screen mode or when window geometry is fixed.  When combined with ----aauuttoo--zzoooomm, zooming will be limited to the specified _p_e_r_c_e_n_t.  Specifying mmaaxx is
             like setting ----aauuttoo--zzoooomm, using ffiillll makes ffeehh zoom the image like the ----bbgg--ffiillll mode.

MMOONNTTAAGGEE MMOODDEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     These additional options can be used for index, montage and (partially) thumbnail mode.

     --aa, ----aallpphhaa _i_n_t
             When drawing thumbnails onto the background, set their transparency level to _i_n_t (0 - 255).

     --bb, ----bbgg _f_i_l_e | ttrraannss
             Use _f_i_l_e as background for your montage.  With this option specified, the montage size will default to the size of _f_i_l_e if no size restrictions were specified.  Alternatively, if _f_i_l_e
             is "trans", the background will be made transparent.

     --XX, ----iiggnnoorree--aassppeecctt
             By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect ratios, while fitting into thumb-width/-height.  This options forces them to be the size set by ----tthhuummbb--wwiiddtthh and
             ----tthhuummbb--hheeiigghhtt.  This will prevent any empty space in the final montage.

     --HH, ----lliimmiitt--hheeiigghhtt _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Limit the height of the montage.

     --WW, ----lliimmiitt--wwiiddtthh _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Limit the width of the montage, defaults to 800 pixels.

             If both ----lliimmiitt--wwiiddtthh and ----lliimmiitt--hheeiigghhtt are specified, the montage will be exactly _w_i_d_t_h x _h_e_i_g_h_t pixels in dimensions.

     --oo, ----oouuttppuutt _f_i_l_e
             Save the created montage to _f_i_l_e.

     --OO, ----oouuttppuutt--oonnllyy _f_i_l_e
             Just save the created montage to _f_i_l_e without displaying it.

     --ss, ----ssttrreettcchh
             Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail size, it will not be enlarged.  If this option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit the thumbnail size.  Aspect ratio
             will be maintained unless ----iiggnnoorree--aassppeecctt is specified.

     --EE, ----tthhuummbb--hheeiigghhtt _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Set thumbnail height.

     --yy, ----tthhuummbb--wwiiddtthh _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Set thumbnail width.

     --JJ, ----tthhuummbb--rreeddrraaww _n
             Only relevant for ----tthhuummbbnnaaiillss: Redraw thumbnail window every _n images.  In ffeehh <= 1.5, the thumbnail image used to be redrawn after every computed thumbnail (so, it updated
             immediately).  However, since the redrawing takes quite long (especially for thumbnail mode on a large filelist), this turned out to be a major performance penalty.  As a workaround,
             the thumbnail image is redrawn every 10th image now by default. Set _n = 1 to get the old behaviour, _n = 0 will only redraw once all thumbnails are loaded.

IINNDDEEXX AANNDD TTHHUUMMBBNNAAIILL MMOODDEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     ----iinnddeexx--iinnffoo _f_o_r_m_a_t
             Show image information based on _f_o_r_m_a_t below thumbnails in index / thumbnail mode.  See _F_O_R_M_A_T _S_P_E_C_I_F_I_E_R_S.  May contain newlines.  Use "--index-info ''" to display thumbnails without
             any info text

             Note: If you specify image-related formats (such as %w or %s), ffeehh needs to load all images to calculate the dimensions of its own window.  So when using them with many files, it will
             take a while before a ffeehh window becomes visible.  Use ----pprreellooaadd to get a progress bar.

     --@@, ----ttiittllee--ffoonntt _f_o_n_t
             Set font to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, no title will be printed.

BBAACCKKGGRROOUUNNDD SSEETTTTIINNGG
     In many desktop environments, ffeehh can also be used as a background setter.  Unless you pass the ----nnoo--ffeehhbbgg option, it will write a script to set the current background to _~_/_._f_e_h_b_g.  So to have
     your background restored every time you start X, you can add "sh ~/.fehbg &" to your X startup script (such as _~_/_._x_i_n_i_t_r_c).  As of ffeehh 2.13, this script is executable, so "~/.fehbg &" will work
     as well.

     Note that ffeehh does not support setting the wallpaper of GNOME shell desktops. In this environment, you can use "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///_p_a_t_h" instead.

     For the ----bbgg--cceenntteerr and ----bbgg--mmaaxx options, you can use the ----ggeeoommeettrryy option to specify an offset from one side of the screen instead of centering the image.  Positive values will offset from
     the left/top side, negative values from the bottom/right.  +0 and -0 are both valid and distinct values.

     Note that all options except ----bbgg--ttiillee support Xinerama.  For instance, if you have multiple screens connected and use e.g.  ----bbgg--cceenntteerr, ffeehh will center or appropriately offset the image on
     each screen.  You may even specify more than one file, in that case, the first file is set on screen 0, the second on screen 1, and so on.

     Use ----nnoo--xxiinneerraammaa to treat the whole X display as one screen when setting wallpapers. You may also use ----xxiinneerraammaa--iinnddeexx to use ffeehh as a background setter for a specific screen.

     ----bbgg--cceenntteerr
             Center the file on the background.  If it is too small, it will be surrounded by a black border

     ----bbgg--ffiillll
             Like ----bbgg--ssccaallee, but preserves aspect ratio by zooming the image until it fits.  Either a horizontal or a vertical part of the image will be cut off

     ----bbgg--mmaaxx
             Like ----bbgg--ffiillll, but scale the image to the maximum size that fits the screen with black borders on one side.

     ----bbgg--ssccaallee
             Fit the file into the background without repeating it, cutting off stuff or using borders.  But the aspect ratio is not preserved either

     ----bbgg--ttiillee
             Tile (repeat) the image in case it is too small for the screen

     ----nnoo--ffeehhbbgg
             Do not write a _~_/_._f_e_h_b_g file

     ffeehh has three config files: _t_h_e_m_e_s for theme definitions, _k_e_y_s for key bindings and _b_u_t_t_o_n_s for mouse button bindings.  It will try to read them from _$_X_D_G___C_O_N_F_I_G___H_O_M_E_/_f_e_h_/, which (when
     XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset) defaults to _~_/_._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_f_e_h_/.  If the files are not found in that directory, it will also try _/_e_t_c_/_f_e_h_/.

     All config files treat lines starting with a "#" character as comments.  Note that mid-line comments are not supported.

TTHHEEMMEESS CCOONNFFIIGG SSYYNNTTAAXX
     _._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_f_e_h_/_t_h_e_m_e_s allows the naming of option groups, called themes.

     It takes entries of the form "_t_h_e_m_e _o_p_t_i_o_n_s _._._.", where _t_h_e_m_e is the name of the entry and _o_p_t_i_o_n_s are the options which will be applied when the theme is used.

     Note that the option parser does not behave like a normal shell: filename expansion and backslash escape sequences are not supported and passed to feh's option parser as-is. However, quoting of
     arguments is respected and can be used for arguments with whitespace.  So, the sequence "--info "foo bar"" works as intended (that is, it display the string "foo bar"), whereas the option
     string "--info foo\ bar" will only display "foo\" and complain about the file bar not existing.  Please keep this in mind when writing theme files.

     An example entry is "imagemap -rVq --thumb-width 40 --thumb-height 30 --index-info '%n\n%wx%h'".

     You can use this theme in two ways.  Either call "ffeehh -Timagemap *.jpg", or create a symbolic link to ffeehh with the name of the theme you want it to use.  For the example above, this would be
     "ln -s `which ffeehh ` ~/bin/imagemap".  Now just run "imagemap *.jpg" to use these options.

     Note that you can split a theme over several lines by placing a backslash at the end of an unfinished line.

     Command line options always override theme options.

     _._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_f_e_h_/_k_e_y_s defines key bindings.  It has entries of the form "_a_c_t_i_o_n [_k_e_y_1 [_k_e_y_2 [_k_e_y_3]]]".

     Each _k_e_y is an X11 keysym name as shown by xev(1), like "Delete".  It may optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which case _k_e_y looks like _m_o_d-_k_e_y_s_y_m (for example
     "C-Delete" for Ctrl+Delete or "C-1-Delete" for Ctrl+Alt+Delete)

     Available modifiers are _C for Control, _S for Shift and _1, _4 for Mod1 and Mod4.  To match an uppercase letter like "S" instead of "s", the Shift modifier is not required.

     Specifying an _a_c_t_i_o_n without any keys unbinds it (i.e. the default bindings are removed).

     _N_o_t_e: Do not use the same keybinding for multiple actions. When binding an action to a new key (or mouse button), make sure to unbind it from its previous action, if present.  ffeehh does not
     check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.

     For a list of the _a_c_t_i_o_n names, see _K_E_Y_S.  Note that not all of the key names used there correspond to X11 keysyms.  Most notably, page up (Prior / Page_Up), page down (Next / Page_Down) and
     the keypad keys (KP_*) do not.

KKEEYYSS
     The following actions and default key bindings can be used in an image window.  (The strings in [square brackets] are the config action names).  If ffeehh is running inside a terminal and its
     standard input is not used for images or filelists, key input from the terminal is also accepted. However, terminal input support is currently limited to most alphanumeric characters (0-9 a-z
     A-Z and some more), return and backspace.

     o [toggle_pointer]
             Toggle pointer visibility

     p, ⟨BackSpace⟩, ⟨Left⟩ [prev_img]
             Show previous image. Selects the previous image in thumbnail mode.

     q, ⟨Escape⟩ [quit]
             Quit ffeehh

     r [reload_image]
             Reload current image.  Useful for webcams

     s [save_image]
             Save the current image as "feh_PID_ID_FILENAME"

     v [toggle_fullscreen]
             Toggle fullscreen

     w [size_to_image]
             Change window size to fit current image size (plus/minus zoom, if set).  In scale-down and fixed-geometry mode, this also updates the window size limits.

     x [close]
             Close current window

     z [jump_random]
             Jump to a random position in the current filelist

     [, ] [prev_dir, next_dir]
             Jump to the first image of the previous or next sequence of images sharing a directory name in the current filelist.  Use --sort dirname if you would like to ensure that all images in a
             directory are grouped together.

     <, > [orient_3, orient_1]
             In place editing - rotate the image 90 degrees (counter)clockwise.  The rotation is lossless, but may create artifacts in some image corners when used with JPEG images.  Rotating in the
             reverse direction will make them go away.  See jpegtran(1) for more about lossless JPEG rotation.  _N_o_t_e_: ffeehh assumes that this feature is used to normalize image orientation. For JPEG
             images, it will unconditionally set the EXIF orientation tag to 1 ("0,0 is top left") after every rotation. See jpegexiforient(1) for details on how to change this flag.

     _ [flip]
             In place editing - vertical flip

     | [mirror]
             In place editing - horizontal flip

     0 .. 9 [action_0 .. action_9]

     ⟨Return⟩ [action_0]
             Run the command defined by ----aaccttiioonn

     ⟨Home⟩ [jump_first]
             Show first image

     ⟨End⟩ [jump_last]
             Show last image

     ⟨page up⟩ [jump_fwd]
             Go forward ~5% of the filelist

     ⟨page down⟩ [jump_back]
             Go backward ~5% of the filelist

             Scroll up

     ⟨keypad Down⟩, ⟨Ctrl+Down⟩ [scroll_down]
             Scroll down.  Note that the scroll keys work without anti-aliasing for performance reasons, hit the render key after scrolling to antialias the image.

     ⟨Alt+Left [scroll_left_page]⟩
             Scroll to the left by one page

     ⟨Alt+Right [scroll_right_page]⟩

     _._c_o_n_f_i_g_/_f_e_h_/_b_u_t_t_o_n_s.  This works like the keys config file: the entries are of the form "_a_c_t_i_o_n [_b_i_n_d_i_n_g]".

     Each _b_i_n_d_i_n_g is a button number.  It may optionally start with modifiers for things like Control, in which case _b_i_n_d_i_n_g looks like _m_o_d-_b_u_t_t_o_n (for example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).

     _N_o_t_e: Do not use the same button for multiple actions.  ffeehh does not check for conflicting bindings, so their behaviour is undefined.  Either unbind the unwanted action, or bind it to another
     unused button.  The order in which you bind / unbind does not matter, though.

     For the available modifiers, see _K_E_Y_S _C_O_N_F_I_G_U_R_A_T_I_O_N _S_Y_N_T_A_X.

     In an image window, the following buttons may be used (The strings in [square brackets] are the config action names).  Additionally, all actions specified in the _K_E_Y_S section can also be bound
     to a button.

     unbound [reload]
             Reload current image

     1 ⟨left mouse button⟩ [pan]
             pan the current image

     2 ⟨middle mouse button⟩ [zoom]
             Zoom the current image

     3 ⟨right mouse button⟩ [toggle_menu]
             Toggle menu

     4 ⟨mousewheel down⟩ [prev_img]
             Show previous image

     5 ⟨mousewheel up⟩ [next_img]
             Show next image

     Ctrl+1 [blur]
             Blur current image

     Ctrl+2 [rotate]
             Rotate current image

     unbound [zoom_in]
             Zoom in

     unbound [zoom_out]
             Zoom out

MMOOUUSSEE AACCTTIIOONNSS
     Default Bindings: When viewing an image, mouse button 1 pans the image (moves it around) or, when only clicked, moves to the next image (slideshow mode only).  Quick drags with less than 2px of
     movement per axis will be treated as clicks to aid graphics tablet users.  Mouse button 2 zooms (click and drag left->right to zoom in, right->left to zoom out, click once to restore zoom to
     100%) and mouse button 3 opens the menu.

     Ctrl+Button 1 blurs or sharpens the image (drag left to blur, right to sharpen); Ctrl+Button 2 rotates the image around the center point.

     A note about pan and zoom modes: In pan mode, if you reach a window border but haven't yet panned to the end of the image, ffeehh will warp your cursor to the opposite border so you can continue
     panning.

     When clicking the zoom button and immediately releasing it, the image will be back at 100% zoom.  When clicking it and moving the mouse while holding the button down, the zoom will be continued
     at the previous zoom level.  The zoom will always happen so that the pixel on which you entered the zoom mode remains stationary.  So, to enlarge a specific part of an image, click the zoom
     button on that part.

SSIIGGNNAALLSS
     In slideshow mode, ffeehh handles the following signals:

     SIGUSR1
             Switch to next image

     SIGUSR2
             Switch to previous image

     Here are some examples of useful option combinations. See also: ⟨http://feh.finalrewind.org/examples/⟩

     feh ~/Pictures
             Show all images in ~/Pictures

     feh -r ~/Pictures
             Recursively show all images found in ~/Pictures and subdirectories

     feh -rSfilename ~/Pictures
             Same as above, but sort by filename. By default, feh will show files in the order it finds them on the hard disk, which is usually somewhat random.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 ~/Pictures
             Show 128x128 pixel thumbnails, limit window width to 1024 pixels.

     feh -t -Sfilename -E 128 -y 128 -W 1024 -P -C /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-dejavu/ -e DejaVuSans/8 ~/Pictures
             Same as above, but enable thumbnail caching in ~/.thumbnails and use a smaller font.

     feh -irFarial/14 -O index.jpg ~/Pictures
             Make an index print of ~/Pictures and all directories below it, using 14 point Arial to write the image info under each thumbnail.  Save the image as index.jpg and don't display it,
             just exit.  Note that this even works without a running X server

     feh --unloadable -r ~/Pictures
             Print all unloadable images in ~/Pictures, recursively

     feh -f by_width -S width --reverse --list .
             Write a list of all images in the directory to by_width, sorted by width (widest images first)

     feh -w ~/Pictures/holidays
             Open each image in ~/Pictures/holidays in its own window

     feh -FD5 -Sname ~/Pictures/presentation
             Show the images in .../presentation, sorted by name, in fullscreen, automatically change to the next image after 5 seconds

     feh -rSwidth -A "mv %F ~/images/%N" ~/Pictures
             View all images in ~/Pictures and below, sorted by width, move an image to ~/image/image_name when enter is pressed

     feh --start-at ./foo.jpg .
             View all images in the current directory, starting with foo.jpg.  All other images are still in the slideshow and can be viewed normally

     feh --start-at foo.jpg *
             Same as above

     feh --info "exifgrep '(Model|DateTimeOriginal|FNumber|ISO|Flash)' %F | cut -d . -f 4-" .
             Show some EXIF information, extracted by exifprobe/exifgrep

     feh --action 'rm %F' -rl --max-dim 1000x800
             Recursively remove all images with dimensions below or equal to 1000x800 pixels from the current directory.

DDEEPPEENNDDEENNCCIIEESS
     ffeehh requires the jjppeeggttrraann and jjppeeggeexxiiffoorriieenntt binaries (usually distributed in "libjpeg-progs" or similar) for lossless rotation.

     To view images from URLs such as http://, you need ffeehh compiled with libcurl support (enabled by default).  See the _V_E_R_S_I_O_N section.

BBUUGGSS
     On systems with giflib 5.1.2, ffeehh may be unable to load gif images. For affected mips, mipsel and arm devices, gif support is completely broken, while on x86 / x86_64 gifs can usually only be
     loaded if they are the first image in the filelist.  This appears to be a bug in giflib, see ⟨https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=813729⟩ for details. Workaround: Use
     ----mmaaggiicckk--ttiimmeeoouutt 55 (or some other positive value) to load gifs with imagemagick instead, or downgrade to giflib 5.1.1, or upgrade to giflib 5.1.4.

     Thumbnail mode is somewhat inefficient, and because of that not nearly as fast as it could be.

     ----ssccaallee--ddoowwnn does not take window decorations into account and may therefore make the window slightly too large.

     When enabled, ----mmaaggiicckk--ttiimmeeoouutt may clutter _/_t_m_p with temporary files produced by ImageMagick. This happens whenever an image is not loaded due to the conversion taking longer than the specified
     timeout.
